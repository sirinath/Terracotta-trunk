Configuration File Samples
--------------------------

The "config-examples" directory contains sample Terracotta configuration file
with example settings appropriate for a typical deployment. The directory also
contains a reference configuration file for a complete explanation of the
options available.


Sample Applications
-------------------

Terracotta ships with sample applications to show by example how to use
Terracotta to cluster the JVM.  The sample applications for Terracotta Sessions
are available from links in Configurator.  For Terracotta for Spring, the sample
applications are in the "samples/spring" directory. For Terracotta Pojos, the
sample applications are in the "samples/pojo" directory.


Administration Tools
--------------------

The "bin" directory contains a script to start the Terracotta Administration 
Console.  Launch the Console tool with the following command.

Unix/Linx:
   ./admin.sh

Windows:
   admin.bat

The Console tool provides a view inside the Terracotta Server, letting you see
activity inside Terracotta at run-time.


Java Virtual Machine (Windows only)
--------------------

The Terracotta Server runs with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) that ships
with Terracotta.

Terracotta Clients can be run with any supported JRE.  The product guide
contains a list of supported JREs.  The JRE used by Terracotta Clients need not
match the one used by the Terracotta Server.

It is possible to control the JVM that the Terracotta Server uses by
setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable.  This should be used with caution,
as doing so may cause the Terracotta Server to run with an unsupported JVM.
