  <title>Specifying the Server Ports</title>

<body>
<H2>Ports</H2>
<p>Each server must specify a unique set of ports upon which its various services will listen. The DSO server component, also known as the DSO L2, listens on a specified port for DSO clients whose shared object graphs it manages. A JMX object server listens on a port for JMX-enabled clients, such as <a href="../../Monitor_server.html">The Terracotta AdminConsole</a>.  The Terracotta Server contains an embedded http server that requires its own port for connecting web clients.
