<H2>Running Your DSO Client</H2>
<p>After you have <a href="Setup_client_launcher.html">created a DSO launch configuration</a> for your application, you can run or debug your application in the standard way, by selecting that configuration by name in either the <b>Debug</b> or <b>Run</b> toolbar dropdown menu.
<H3>Using a Launch Shortcut</H3>
<p>An alternate way to run your DSO application, and create a new DSO launch configuration as a side-effect, is to select your instrumented class containing a Main method, and choose the <code>Run As</code> or <code>Debug As|Terracotta DSO Application</code> context menu. If you invoke these actions using the shortcut keystrokes, you will be asked to specify the class containing a Main method that you would like to run. A DSO Launch Configuration named after the class you are running or debugging will be created automatically, which you can further edit using the Debug or Run launch configuration editor dialogs.
<H3>How to Tell that your DSO Application is Running</H3>
<p>If you start your instrumented class containing a Main method using a launch shortcut or a standard launch configuration other than <code>Terracotta DSO Application</code>, then your application will start but it will not be using the Terracotta DSO runtime infrastructure and, therefore, will act as a standard Java application. You can tell when the DSO infrastructure is in use by the startup output that appears in the Console View.<BR><BR>
