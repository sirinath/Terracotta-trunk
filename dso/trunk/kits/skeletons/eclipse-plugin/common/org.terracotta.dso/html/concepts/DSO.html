<H2>Terracotta Distributed Shared Objects (DSO)</H2>
<p>Terracotta DSO is a distributed programming framework that supports transparent mirroring of standard Java objects across multiple virtual machines through a flexible declarative configuration mechanism. The system is comprised of a main server and an arbitrary number of attached clients. If you are familiar with the concepts behind distributed- and multi-threaded programming, working with DSO should not be a challenge.<BR>
<p>The main concepts behind DSO are <a href="Roots.html">Roots</a>, <a href="Locks.html">Locks</a>, <a href="Distributed_methods.html">Distributed Methods</a>, and <a href="Transient_fields.html">Transient fields</a>. With DSO you can declare a field as being the root of a shared object graph. Methods that modify or access those shared objects are declared as locks, providing distributed synchonization. Distributed methods can be declared on a shared instance, ensuring an invocation on one shared instance is invoked on all other shared instances across the cluster. Any class that contains a root or whose instances are part of a shared graph must be <a href="Instrumentation.html">Instrumented</a> for use with DSO. Class instrumentation involves creating a new version of a class that adds additional information and code in support of DSO. This adaptation of your class occurs automatically at runtime and as needed by DSO. An object being shared may contain fields that are not approrpiate for sharing. Declaring such fields as transient excludes them from distribution, just as using the Java <tt>transient</tt> keywork prevents a field from taking part in the default serialization process. Declarative mechanisms are provide to re-initialize transient data when a shared object is materialized via DSO.<BR>

<p>Terracotta has pre-instrumented many of the most useful system classes, such as <code>java.util.HashMap</code>, but in order for them to be used they must be contained in a <a href="BootJar.html">Boot JAR</a>. A Boot JAR is a special class archive that is given precedence over any other class in the runtime system. If it weren't for the concept of the Boot JAR Terracotta would be unable to provide instrumented versions of the system classes. Because not every known system class has been pre-instrumented and added to the default Boot JAR, a developer may have the need to create a new Boot JAR specifically for use by their DSO application.<BR>

<p>A major design goal of DSO is that any plain old Java object (POJO) can be clustered, even without access to the source code. Even objects that were not initially created to be multi-thread safe can be made clustered with DSO thanks to the declaritive configuration. A field that wasn't tagged with the Java <tt>transient</tt> keyword can still be declared to be a transient DSO field, and thus not be clustered. A method that manipulates a shared object needn't do so in a <tt>synchronized</tt> block, but can still be declared to act as a Named Lock, providing cluster-wide wait & notify.<BR>
