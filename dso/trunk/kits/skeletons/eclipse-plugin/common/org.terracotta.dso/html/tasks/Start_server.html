<H2>Starting the Terracotta Server</H2>
<p>Once you have created one or more server configurations you can run the Terracotta server using any one of those configurations by invoking the project context menus and selecting the 'Start server' item.  A submenu containing a list of each of the configurations you have created will appear for you to choose from.  Assuming the configuration you created was valid and there isn't already another server listening on the prescribed DSO listen port, you will see a startup message from the newly running server in the Console window.
<p>If you start a server from outside of the Eclipse environment, the DSO plugin will be unable to provide any indication of its state.
