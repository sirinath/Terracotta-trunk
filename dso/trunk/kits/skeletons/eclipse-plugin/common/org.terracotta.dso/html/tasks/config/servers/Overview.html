<H2>Configuring Your DSO Servers</H2><BR>
<p>Each Terracotta server requires certain information to run,
  primarily related to the ports upon which its various services
  should listen. To specify this information, double-click on the name
  of your configuration file in the Eclipse workspace view to display
  The Configuration Editor. This editor is composed of a set of tabbed
  pages, each related to different aspects of the configuration. For a
  detailed description of the pages that make up this editor refer
  to <a href="../Overview.html#ConfigEditor">Configuring Your
	Terracotta Project</a>.  The remainder of this document describes
