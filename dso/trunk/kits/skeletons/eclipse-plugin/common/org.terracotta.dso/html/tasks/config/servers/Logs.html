<p>The Terracotta Server writes messages of varying degrees of importance to the specified log file location. The default location of the log directory is the <code>terracotta</code> folder at the root of your project. You can use various special codes to created a log file location based on well-known system properties.  These code are listed below. Log file rotation is used to keep a single file from becoming unmanageably large.<BR>
