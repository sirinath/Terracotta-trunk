# <b>THIS CODE MUST RUN IN BOTH RUBY AND JRUBY.</b> It is used by both the
# buildsystem and the monkey-generation logic. Be extremely careful to test
# it in both and to not write code that won't work on one or the other.

# We depend on certain other files, but have to use a cross-platform-safe way
# of including them -- hence all this magic.

# This class represents a path on the filesystem. It provides operations that
# let you do things with that path in a platform-independent manner. For example,
# Ruby uses strings to represent file paths, but writing code to determine things
# like "is this an absolute pathname?" is very difficult to do with strings in a
# platform-independent manner. If you use instances of FilePath instead, you'll
# be able to perform these operations without worrying about which platform you're
# on.
#
# Be sure you call #to_s on an object that might be a FilePath before you pass it
# to any Ant tasks or any other code that may call directly into Java (from JRuby,
# that is). As of this writing, you get nasty Java stack traces (that omit all
# JRuby filenames and line numbers) otherwise, and these aren't very fun or easy
# to track down.
#
# Feel free to add methods to this class to do anything else you might need. It's
# not meant to be complete in general; it's meant to be complete for what we need,
# right now.
