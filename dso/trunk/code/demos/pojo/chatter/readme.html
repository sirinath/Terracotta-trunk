   <h1>Terracotta DSO</h1>
   Chatter Sample Application

   <h2>About</h2>
   Chatter is a simple chat application that allows multiple users connected 
   to the same Terracotta Server to communicate via text messages. After 
   pressing &lt;ENTER&gt;, the text displays on all client nodes.<br>
   <br>
   Chatter is implemented by sharing a very simple model across a cluster. 
   In this case, the model is the <code>MessageManager</code> which keeps a record
   of all the messages sent in an <code>ArrayList</code>. Writing to the <code>MessageManager</code> 
   is synchronized across the cluster to ensure data integrity.<br>
   <br>
   One relevant implementation detail is that the listeners to the
   <code>MessageManager</code> are declared as transient in the source code 
   and the tc-config.xml file declares that the <code>MessageManager</code> class 
   honors the transient modifier. This makes that the listeners registered to the <code>MessageManager</code> are not clustered, even if the entire object itself is. 
   <p/>
   The <code>MessageManager::notifyListeners(Message)</code> method is declared as distributed. This means that whenever this method is invoked 
   from any one client, it also fires in the context of all the other clients in the cluster.
   <p/>

   <h2>Build Instructions</h2>
   This sample application ships built ready to run.&nbsp;  If you modify the
   application code, use the provided <code>build.xml</code> file to re-build the
   application with Apache Ant (<code>ant build</code>).

   <h2>Run Instructions</h2>
   The command-line steps below for executing scripts on Windows can be replaced
   by double-clicking the script instead.<br>
   <ol>
      <li>Start a Terracotta server from the <code>dso/samples</code> directory.<br><br>
            Unix:    <samp>./start-demo-server.sh</samp><br>
            Windows: <samp>start-demo-server.bat</samp><br>
      <li>Start multiple copies of the application from the <code>dso/samples/chatter</code> directory.<br><br>
            Unix:    <samp>./run.sh &<br>./run.sh &</samp><br>
            Windows: <samp>run.bat<br>run.bat</samp><br><br>
            Optionally, a user name may be supplied to the run scripts; otherwise the chat client 
            will generate a random screen name for however many instances
            of the Chatter client you bring up.<br><br>
      <li>View application.<br>
   				 In each window type text and press &lt;ENTER&gt; to see the text
   				 replicated across all nodes in the cluster.
   </ol>
