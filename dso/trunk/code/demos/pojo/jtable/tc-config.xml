      <!-- Our app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
           tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
           will broadcast changes in their state.

           A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
           classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
           this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
           can be concise

           Here, we say, instrument all of the classes found in all of the 
           packages of our sample app -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <include>
          <class-expression>*..*</class-expression>
        </include>
      </instrumented-classes>

      <!-- We declare the field 'demo.jtable.Main.model' a root, making it 
           available for all instances of our app that runs via DSO -->
      <roots>
        <root>
          <field-name>demo.jtable.Main.model</field-name>
        </root>
      </roots>
