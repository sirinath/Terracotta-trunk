SendSignal.EXE is a little utility that allows one to send a
CRTL-BREAK keystroke to a VM running on windows. CTRL-BREAK is how
you tell the VM to do a thread dump on windows (analogous to a kill
-3 on unix)

We call SendSignal from com.tc.util.runtime.ThreadDump.dumpThreads()
DON'T move/remove it w/o considering that class first
