# Contains a set of classes that allow us to examine the XML files generated
# by JUnit when it runs our tests, and create a set of objects that summarizes
# the key information contained in them. Then, we can print this information
# out to the screen, use it to fail the build (or whatever) as necessary, or
# even serialize it to disk for later fast retrieval.
#
# Note: there is a critical difference between 'testrun_results' and
# 'testrun_record'. 'testrun_results' understands where we should store
# test results, temporary files, Ant property files, and so on; in other words,
# it is used at test-run time to figure out where to store everything.
# 'testrun_record' is used after the fact, to analyze a set of previously-
# performed test runs (in fact, they could've been run days ago; it reads 
# everything from disk, not from memory). 
#
# There is, however, one important exception here: the setUp and tearDown
# methods on TestRunRecord are actually called before and after we run tests,
# respectively. This is because TestRunRecord needs a little extra information,
# above and beyond what the rest of the system would ordinarily use, to do its
# bookkeeping; this lets TestRunRecord write out that information as appropriate.
# This is the only exception, though, and the rest of this file is all about
# analyzing previously-run tests from files stored on disk.
