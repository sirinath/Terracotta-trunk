This is a log of everyones performance tests. Each entry should have a few things
1) Date/Time of test
2) Change number (this is tricky because change numbers change in bk and you may be tweeking things but do your best)
3) Machines used
4) Timing results
5) was the machine cpu bound/disk bound/network etc..
6) was the test gc bound or memory constrained
7) What test were you running
8) Notes (what ever else happened that was interesting

Date:		June 14, 2005
Test:		GC Test
Change Number:	???
Results:	min: 0, max: 135825, mean: 5016.09449374289
Config:		bones only, 3 clients
Notes:		The test ran for over a week.  The min/max/mean refer to the
		amount of time it took to perform 100 iterations of the test
		loop on a single client.
		
		The very large max value is due to the synchronization on the
		object store during object removal.  We currently synchronize
		the object store on all operations.  Without such
		synchronization, were were getting missing object exceptions.
		We suspect Sleepycat doesn't handle transactions well, but we
		aren't really sure what's going on.

1) June 20th I ran the ticker demo with lots of changes.
3) kermit (1.6 ghz g5)
4) took 790 seconds to do the initializing of 1,000,000 records memory usage looked good
5) Cpu was pegged
6) memory looked good ran server with 256 meg
7) TickerDemo
8) In the past this test had never completed so this was encouraging. It is however still kind of slow
