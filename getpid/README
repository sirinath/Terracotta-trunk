Here lies the native source for com.tc.util.runtime.GetPid.getPid().

NOTES:
- The generated com_tc_util_runtime_GetPid.h is needlessly replicated
  in each OS specific directory.
- Additionally, the JVM include files are copied in the Windows
  directory since I didn't know how to set the proper include path in
  the Visual Studio project.
- The output of each build resides in tc/lib/src.test/native/${OS}
