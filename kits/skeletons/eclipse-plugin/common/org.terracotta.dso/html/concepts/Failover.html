<H2>DSO Failover</H2>
<p>If a single server is responsible for maintaining all of the shared
  data used by your DSO application instances then what happens if the
  virtual-machine in which the Terracotta server is executing should
  fail catastrophically? What if the power in the machine room goes down? There are many real-world situation that may occur that could possibly put your application out-of-business.<BR>
<H3>Redundant DSO Servers</H3>
<p>Your DSO system can be setup with servers configured to mitigate the risk of a catastrophic failure to your DSO applications. The main idea is to have multiple servers in different physical locations, sharing common storage. You configure your servers to persist all changes to your shared data. Each server is started prior to starting your DSO applications. The first server to begin running will handle all DSO duties and each of the others will be standing by ready to take over should the active server fail. Using the AdminConsole you can clearly see which server is active and that the remaining members of your cluster are started by standing by.<BR>
<p>Even with a single server configured to persist all shared data changes, if that server were to terminate unexpectedly, attached clients would block and be able to reattach to the server after it was restarted. When a server is configured in this persistable mode, they way to properly stop that server is with Ctrl-C, sending it the KILL signal or, under Windows, to use the Task Manager <code>End Process</code> feature.<BR>
