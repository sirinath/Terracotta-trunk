<H2>DSO Class Instrumentation</H2>
<p>Any class that contains a declared root, lock or distributed method needs to be instrumented, or adapted, in such a way that DSO can intervene to accomplish data distribution to ensure the integrity of the data. Class instrumentation involves creating a new version of a class that adds additional information and code in support of DSO features.<BR>
<p>The set of classes that are to be instrumented are specified through a pattern language that is based on the AspectWorks Aspect-oriented Programming (AOP) framework. A specific name can be used as well as short-hand wild-cards. The following are valid instrumentation <i>include</i> patterns:<BR><BR>
<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
 <tr>
   <td><code>com.project.Main</code></td>
   <td>specifies only class <code>Main</code> in <code>com.project</code></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code>com.project.*</code></td>
   <td>specifies all classes in <code>com.project</code></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code>com.project.*Main</code></td>
   <td>specifies all classes in <code>com.project</code> ending with <code>Main</code></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td><code>com..*</code></td>
   <td>specifies all classes under <code>com</code></td>
  </tr>
</table><BR>
<p>Specifying a root or lock that is not contained in an instrumented class will result in a runtime exception when accessed.<BR>
<H3>Excluding Classes from Instrumentation</H3>
<p>
<p>To exclude from transparent distribution particular data members of an instrumented class, you can list those members as <a href="Transient_fields.html">Transient Fields</a>.<BR>
<p>For more information on how to specify the set of instrumented classes for your DSO application refer to <a href="../tasks/config/app/Classes.html">Specifying Instrumented Classes</a>.<BR>
<H3>Boot JARs</H3>
<p>Instrumented system classes, such as <code>java.lang.String</code>, must reside in a Boot JAR. For more information about Boot JARs refer to <a href="BootJar.html">DSO Boot JARs</a>.<BR>
<p>Fore more information on how to create a Boot JAR specifically for your DSO application refer to <a href="../tasks/config/app/BootJar.html">Creating a Custom Boot JAR</a>.<BR>
