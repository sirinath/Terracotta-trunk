<H2>DSO Distributed Methods</H2>
<p>Any method of an object contained in a shared object graph can be distributed, meaning that an invocation of that method in one virtual-machine will trigger the same method invocation on all the <i>mirrored</i> instances in other virtual-machines. This is a useful mechanism for implementing a distributed listener model. The <a href="../ref/demos/shared_editor.html">Shared Editor</a> demo makes use of a distributed method to inform each view that the set of drawing objects has changed, notifying the view to update itself. It is important to note that distributed methods work in the context of a shared instance that defines that method. It is not sufficient that the instance' class be instrumented, it must also be contained in a shared object graph as defined by the set of shared roots declared by your DSO Application configuration.<BR>
<P>For information on how to specify a distributed method refer to <a href="../tasks/config/app/Methods.html">Specifying Distributed Methods</a>.  For information on how to specify share roots refer to <a href="../tasks/config/app/Roots.html">Specifying Shared Roots</a>.<BR>
