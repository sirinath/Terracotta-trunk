<H2>Boot JAR</H2>
<p>Java system classes are loaded from a special system property <tt>java.boot.class.path</tt>.  System classes are those classes originating from the core system libraries defining the java package hierarchy, as well as others. These bootstrap classes are treated specially by the Java virtual-machine in that they are given precedence over, and a higher security clearance than, classes loaded via the standard <tt>java.class.path</tt> system property. The -Xbootclasspath argument to the java command lets you add bootstrap classes and resources.
<p>Java system classes that have been pre-instrumented for use with DSO must be made available to the Java virtual-machine as bootstrap classes, such that they can replace their original forms. Terracotta provides pre-instrumented versions of many of the most useful system classes, such as the collection classes in the <tt>java.util</tt> package. When you run a DSO application, it is required that the DSO Boot JAR be prepended to the bootstrap class path.
<p>Circumstances may arise where a shared object graph you have declared includes a system class that is not one of those pre-instrumented by Terracotta. In that case, you will need to declare that class in your DSO configuration and ensure that a new, custom Boot JAR is created, containing an instrumented version of that class. You will further need to be sure to use that custom Boot JAR when running your DSO application.
<p>For information on creating a custom DSO BootJar refer to <a href="../tasks/config/app/BootJar.html">Boot JAR classes</a>.<BR>
