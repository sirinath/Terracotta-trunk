<H2>DSO Transient Fields</H2>
<p>Certain types of data members of an instrumented class should never be part of a shared object graph. For instance, a thread or a user-interface object are intimately tied to the hosting virtual machine. Yet, members such as these may be contained in a class that you would like to be part of a shared object graph. To indicate to DSO that these data members be exluded from distributed mirroring, you can list them as Transient Fields. For information on specifying transient fields refer to <a href="../tasks/config/app/Transient_fields.html">Specifying DSO Transient Fields</a>.<BR>
