<H2>Stopping the Terracotta Server</H2>
<p>Once you have started a Terracotta server using a configuration you have created, you can terminate that server by invoking the project context menus and selecting the <b>Stop server</b> item.
<p>Note that any servers started outside of the Eclipse environment cannot be managed by the DSO plugin.
