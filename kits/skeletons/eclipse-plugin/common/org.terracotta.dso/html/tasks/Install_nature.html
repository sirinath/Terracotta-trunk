<p>A dialog will be displayed asking for the name of any existing
Terracotta configuration file that may already exist in your
project, defaulting to <code>tc-config.xml</code>, as well as
any Java options that should be used when running the Terracotta server.

<p>If no configuration file exists at the specified location, a default
configuration file will be created. A folder named <code>terracotta</code>
will be created at the root of your project workspace, meant to be the location of log
files and other artifacts that are created during the execution of
your DSO system. Each of your Java modules are inspected for the
purpose of providing graphical adornments associated with the
configuration you provided. Finally, the project node in the
Workspace Browser will be adorned with an indication that Terracotta
capabilities have been added.<BR><BR>
