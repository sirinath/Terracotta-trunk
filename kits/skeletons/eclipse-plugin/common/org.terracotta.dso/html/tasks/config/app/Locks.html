<H2>Distributed Locks</H2>
<p>A DSO distributed lock is a form of a distributed semaphore, protecting areas of code that modify members of a shared root from simultaneous access.  If you're familiar with distributed programming methods, you can think of a lock as a distributed synchronized method.<BR>
<p>To specify a distributed lock, use the <code>Locks</code> tab of The DSO Application page of The Configuration Editor. You can manually enter a lock <a href="Pattern_language.html">method pattern</a> or you can select a method from a chooser. Alternately, you can navigate to a particular method in your project using the Workspace Browser or Outline View, invoke the <code>Terracotta</code> context menu and choose either <code>Named lock</code> or <code>Auto lock</code>.<BR>
<p>For more information on the concept of DSO distributed locks refer to <a href="../../../concepts/Locks.html">DSO Distributed Locks</a>.<BR>
