      <!-- Our app requires these custom objects/classes to be shared - the following declarations
      tells DSO which ones they are. When the app runs under DSO, instances of these classes
      will broadcast changes in their state.

      A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO, is to group the 
      classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
      this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
      can be concise -->
      <instrumented-classes>
        <!-- Start by including all classes for instrumentation.
        It's more efficient to instrument only those classes that
        hold shared roots or are part of a shared root graph -->
