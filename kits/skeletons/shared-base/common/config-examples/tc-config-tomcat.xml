      allow sharing. When the app runs under DSO, shared instances of these classes will
      broadcast changes in their state.

      A good idiom when writing an app that you intend to cluster via TC DSO is to group the 
      classes you wish to share under a single package (although if you follow the MVC pattern
      this tends to happen naturally) - this way the list of classes you wish to instrument
      can be concise -->

        It's more efficient to instrument only those classes that
        hold shared roots or are part of a shared root's graph -->
