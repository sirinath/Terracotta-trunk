* Added distributed wait and notify support. 
* Once and Only Once messaging option
* First version of simulator that can do multi vm coordination.
* First version of client side memory management
* Added support for Logical collections including:
  HashSet, LinkedList, ArrayList, Stack, Vector, HashMap
* Fixed bug where protected tc transients didn't work
* Importing a previous Terracotta DSO Eclipse project incorrectly reports
  that project as still having the Terracotta nature. A project should cease
  to have a Terracotta nature when it is removed from the workspace.
  When this happens you will be unable to view the TC config file or really
  do anything TC-related. Remove the Terracotta nature and then add it
  back again.
