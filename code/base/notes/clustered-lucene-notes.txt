Clustered Lucene 2.0.0
----------------------

Q: What is the feature for (what gap does it fill)? 
A: Support for clustering the Lucene Framework.


Q: What does the feature do? 
A: It encapsulates the clustering configuration for the Lucene Framework, client apps using 
the Clustered Lucene module will no longer need to worry about these details, allowing them 
to concentrate on the details of configuring their app for clustering in Terracotta.


Q: How does it work? 
A: The Clustered Lucene module provides a fragment of Terracotta configuration to instrument
the classes under the 'org.apache.lucene.store' package. It also specifies lock 
configurations for the RAMDirectory and RAMOutputStream methods.

To examine this fragment, you may extract the file named 'terracotta.xml' form the Clustered
Lucene module's jar file, which can be found in the modules directory of a Terracotta 
installation.

Client applications can then declare a RAMDirectory field, and mark it as root.

A sample application using the Clustered Lucene module can be downloaded from:
http://svn.terracotta.org/svn/forge/projects/labs/terracotta-lucene-examples/trunk/terracotta-lucene-examples


Q: Does it introduce any new concepts? If so, what are they? 
A: No.


Q: Is there an impact on configuration? 
A: Yes. You'll need to specify in the client configuration that the Clustered Lucene module
must be loaded.

In the clients/modules section of the config, add the following entry:

<clients>
  <modules>
    <module name="clustered-lucene" version="2.0.0"/>
  </modules>
</clients>


Q: Is there an impact on development (e.g., new way of working with eclipse)? 
A: None.


A: Is there an impact on scalability or performance? 
A: Although the configuration was written to make the locks more efficient (eg: write-locks 
only on methods that actually modify data), we still need to write tests to measure performance
and scalability.


Q: Is there an impact on deployment and operation? 
A: No. The Clustered Lucene module, starting at version 2.3.0, is one of the modules that 
come pre-packaged with Terracotta.


Q: Is there anything you'd like to add to the FAQ and/or the troubleshooting guide? 
A: Yes. This module was written and tested against Lucene 2.0.0; though it might work against 
subsequent releases, this is far from guaranteed.


Q: Error messages?
A: None.
