   <h1>The Terracotta Server Administration Client</h1>

The Terracotta Server provides a rich-client application that can be used to monitor various aspects of your running system.  The server also hosts an optional JMX server that is the standard mechanism for interacting with the server in an operational sense.  Various statistics concerning the server as well as any connected clients are available via the JMX protocol. The AdminClient is a JMX client.

<h1>Using the AdminClient</h1>

In order to monitor a Terracotta server using the AdminClient, the JMX support in that server must be enabled, which it is by default.  The AdminClient maintains a set of servers that you have defined.  If no servers are defined, a default server is created with default values for the server hostname (localhost) and JMX port (9525).  You can define any number of servers and these server definitions are maintained across sessions.

<h1>Connecting to a running server</h1>

Once you have defined a server and made sure the server is running, you can connect the AdminClient to that server by selecting the server node in the navigation tree on the left side of the window.  On the right side of the window will be displayed a form containing the server connection information.  Click the "Connect" button.  After a short pause, various nodes will appear under the server node and an indication that the server is running and its start time will appear in the server panel.  An alternate way to connect to a particular server is to bring up the context menu for that server node (usually a right-click operation) and select the "Connect" item.

<h1>Disconnecting from a running server</h1>

Once you have connected the AdminClient to a running server, you can disconnect your session from that server by clicking the "Disconnect" button on the server panel or by selecting the "Disconnect" item from the server node's context menu.  Should a running server be terminated while the AdminClient is connected, the AdminClient will notice the absense of the server and gracefully disconnect.

<h1 name="DSO">Viewing the DSO subsystem</h1>

<h2 name="Roots">Roots</h2>

Using DSO, you can specify that certain fields of your Java classes be transparently shared amongst multiple DSO-enabled applications.  These shared fields in your classes are referred to as DSO <b>roots</b>.  You can view the complete set of roots known to the server by selecting the <b>Roots</b> node.  In addition, each individual root is also broken out as a separate node under the Roots node.  You can navigate through the root object graph and refresh the contents of the root by selecting the "Refresh" context menu on the root node.

<h2 name="Classes">Classes</h2>

Terracotta Distributed Shared Object (DSO) allows for transparent, clustered object state synchronization.  To accomplish this feature, some of your application classes will be adapted, or transmogrified, into new classes that are cluster-aware.  The set of all such adapted classes known to the server are displayed in the <b>Classes</b> panel.  The <b>Tabular</b> tab show all the adapted classes in a spreadsheet view, including the class name and a count of the number of instances of the classes that have been created since the server started.  The <b>Tree</b> tab shows a heirarchical, or Java package, view of the adapted classes.  Finally, the <b>TreeMap</b> tab shows a presentation making it easy to quickly distinguish the most (and least) heavily used adapted classes.  These views are a snapshots of the adapted classes known to the server.  You can refresh these values by selecting the "Refresh" context menu on the <b>Classes</b> node.

<h2 name="Clients">Clients</h2>

When a DSO-enabled application connects to an server being monitored in the AdminClient, a client node is created under the <b>Clients</b> node.  A client is compromised of a communication channel ID, a hostname, and a port.  Under each client node you will find additional client-specific statistics, such as <a href="#TransactionRate">Transaction Rate</a>.  When a DSO-enabled client disconnects from an server, that clients node is automatically removed from the navigation tree.

<h2>Cache Activity</h2>

The DSO server in-memory cache can be configured to hold some maximum number of objects from client <b>root</b> object graphs.  When the number of shared objects known to the server exceeds the cache capacity, objects that have been Least-Recently-Used (LRU) are <b>flushed</b> from the in-memory cache to the disk cache. When a client requires an object that has been flushed to disk, that object is <b>faulted</b> from disk back into the in-memory cache, and the object state is transmitted to the client.  The following two statistics relate to the DSO server cache activity.

<h3 name="ObjectFlushRate">Object Flush Rate</h3>

The Object Flush Rate DSO statistic shows a measure of how many objects are being flushed out of the client memory. These objects are available in the server if needed at a later point in time.

<h3 name="ObjectFaultRate">Object Fault Rate</h3>

The Object Fault Rate DSO statistic shows a measure of how many objects are being faulted into the client memory from the server.

<h2><a name="CacheMissRate">Cache Miss Rate</a></h2>

The Cache Miss Rate DSO statistic shows a measure of how many objects are being faulted from the disk-cache per second, as opposed to retrieving from the server's in-memory cache.

<h2><a name="TransactionRate">Object Transaction Rate</a></h2>

The Object Transaction Rate DSO statistic shows a measure of how many getfield/putfield calls have been invoked on shared objects.  For instance, if you have defined a root that includes an int field, setting that fields value is a single transaction.

<h2 name="GarbageCollection">Garbage collection</h2>

Objects in a DSO root object graph may become unreferenced at any time.  DSO occasionally garbage collects such unreferenced objects.  You can view the garbage collection statistics in the <b>Garbage collection</b> panel.  Each time a collection occurs, that information is broadcast to the AdminClient, there is no need to refresh.  You can view the gc iteration index, the start time of that iteration, the time elapsed during the sweep, the total number of shared objects held by the server, the number of shared objects that are candidates for collection, and finally the total number of shared objects that were actually collected.
