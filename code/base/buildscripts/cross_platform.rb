# This file contains implementations of Platform objects, which offer services
# for executing commands on the system and getting the value of environment
# variables. This encapsulates some of the differences between Ruby and JRuby.
#
# Note that Platform objects are not completely interchangeable; for example,
# the JRuby object offers methods that let you get the next Ant output-
# property name, which doesn't even make any sense under Ruby.
#
# To get a Platform object, you should simply call
# CrossPlatform.create_implementation. If you're on JRuby, you'll need to
# pass in a hash with an AntBuilder object under the :ant key; if you're
# under Ruby, you can pass in any hash you want, or none at all.

# This module provides functionality for figuring out whether we're running
# under JRuby or not (i.e., normal Ruby), and for figuring out what class we
# should instantiate to get the correct kind of Platform object for our platform.
