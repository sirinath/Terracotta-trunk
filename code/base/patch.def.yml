# Patch level identifier.  May be any arbitrary string, but for official
# patches should be a positive integer in increasing sequence.
# The patch level identifier may be overridden on the tcbuild command-line
# using the 'level' argument to the patch target.
#
# Example:
# level: 1
level: 1

# List of files to include in the patch tar.  File paths listed here are
# relative to the kit root directory.  Use the YAML syntax for lists:
# one entry per line, each line beginning with a dash.
#
# Example:
#- lib/tc.jar
files: 
 - lib/tc.jar
