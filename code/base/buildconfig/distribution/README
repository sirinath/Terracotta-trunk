If you change anything in one of these files, due to our current setup, you have to make the same changes
in all of the files.

For example, if you add a new project to be included in tc.jar, that project has to be in Eclipse and EE 
kit as well. Hence the same add has to be in dso-enterprise.def.yml and web-enterprise.def.yml
