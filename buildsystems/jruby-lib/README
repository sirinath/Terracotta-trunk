Some of the libraries we use here included Ant inside the jar which leads to version mismatch propblem

There should be only one source of Ant classes and currently it's coming from ant-1.7.1.jar

Leafcutter and izpack jars used to contain Ant classes in it. I've deleted org/apache/tools/ant inside them.

If you make an update of leafcutter and izpack, or adding a new library to be on JRuby path, make sure
you remove any existing Ant classes.
